The pin tumblers and other components of a gas cap lock can start corriding if not regularly maintained.  This effect is accelerated when a bike is left outside for long periods.  A sign that corrision is occurring is if you have to struggle to unlock your gas cap.  This is a minor inconvenience initially so it's easy to ignore, but over time your lock will corride to the point where your key won't budge the lock at all.

To maintain your gas cap lock, every other week spray a little graphite based lubricant into the key hole.  Engage and disengage the lock a few times to spread the lubricant around.
