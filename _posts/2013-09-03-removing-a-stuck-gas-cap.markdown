procedure:
- steps: 
  - Find the mounting bracket in the crevice between the gas cap and rim.  From there the spot to drill is about 1 cm inwards towards the center of the gas cap.  
  - Be careful as to not drill into the bolt/screw itself.
  - The drill bit in the image is 6 mm.

- steps:
  - Carefully pull out the entire gas cap assembly so that the metal shavings from the drilling do not fall into the tank.
  - You can clean out the area with a vacuum and wet rag.

You've sprayed every type of lubrication into the gas cap key hole and the lock still won't budge.  All hope is not lost though, you can always remove the entire gas cap assembly.  If you're lucky, the bolts that mount the gas cap assembly to the tank are all accessible.  If not, you'll have to do some drilling like we do on the following 2008-2012 Kawasaki Ninja 250R.
